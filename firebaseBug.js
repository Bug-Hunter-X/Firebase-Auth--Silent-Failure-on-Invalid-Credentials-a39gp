The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during the authentication process.  This can lead to silent failures where the application doesn't provide clear feedback to the user about why authentication failed. For example, a common issue is when the user enters an incorrect password, and the app simply fails to update the UI, leaving the user confused.
