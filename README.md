# Firebase Authentication Silent Failure Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: silent failures due to invalid credentials or network problems.  The application lacks proper error handling, leaving the user unaware of why authentication failed.  The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and user feedback.

## Problem
The original code attempts to sign in a user without adequately handling potential errors. If the credentials are incorrect or a network error occurs, the application doesn't display an error message, leaving the user confused and frustrated.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing robust error handling using `.catch()` to intercept any errors thrown during the authentication process. The solution then displays informative error messages to the user, guiding them on how to resolve the authentication issue. This greatly improves the user experience.
